# Once the user logs in, they can write and upload notes to the database.
# The user can write and upload notes to the database after logging in.
# The user has two modes. In one mode, a single note is made daily; in the 
# other mode, he can write multiple nodes in a day.
# The state of the modes of the app is saved in the database.
# So the user state is saved when the user toggles the button.
# Along with the note data, the day, date, and year are also saved in the database.
# While uploading the data, cards and the date and day when the upload is clicked are saved.
# The note data is then passed through the NLTK Ml library, which gives the sentiment of the note data. The sentiment is shown using a multicolor-bordered color.
# The sentiment is then stored in the database. The database stores the sentiment, which is also stored.
# The sentiments are shown via different color shades. The red color shade shows some negative sentiment, and the green color shows positive sentiment. The yellow color shows a neutral sentiment.
# The sentiments are also saved in the database.
# All the data is saved using SQLite in the database.
# The user can search for his daily journal or notes directly from the database using the search button. When the user clicks the button search button along with the date of input, the search in the database is done, and all the notes on the appropriate date are shown. 
# There is a delete button that helps the user to delete his account. The password and the user email are verified before the deletion process proceeds.
